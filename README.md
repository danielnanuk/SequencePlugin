#### Name history
+ **SequencePlugin** Maintained by Kentaur(Kesh Sibilev, ksibilve@yahoo.com) until 2011
+ **SequencePluginReload** Maintained by Vanhg(Evan Fan, fanhuagang@gmail.com) 2011 - 2015
+ **SequenceDiagram** Maintained by Vanco(Evan Fan, fanhuagang@gmail.com) since 2016

#### Why change name?
Since 2011, I found a solution of NPE of original **SequencePlugin**, so I write email to Kentaur with my solution,
He said he was not coding any more. Instead, he send me the code. I fix the NPE issue and publish to plugin
repository with new name **SequencePluginReload**.

But in 2015, the IntelliJ change the login system, and I lost my account, cannot continue publish new version to
the repository.

In 2016, I change the Name again to **SequenceDiagram** and host the source code on [github](https://github.com/Vanco/SequencePlugin).
Now it open source.

Thanks Kentaur for the great work on the original source.
